week3:

The project is about energy consumption using power bi. In this project I have created 4 dashboards 1)overview dashboard,2)water dashboard,3)gas dashboard, and 4)electricity dashboard. For this project, 2 functions have been created one is the total cost function, and the other is the units consumed function. Using the created functions and visuals in the Power BI I have created the four dashboards. I have created bookmarks and added a button called "menu" which displays the menu of all four dashboards, if we click on the selected dashboard it will be redirected to the dashboard that you have selected and I have customized the dashboard user interface like changing the background color using different shapes and editing the font color and adding a border to the options in the dashboard and rounding the border of them and added the respected image to the respected dashboard and added dashboard navigation.
